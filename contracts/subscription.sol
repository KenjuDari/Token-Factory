/* Contract of basic subscription

  NOTE that thic contract require 1 whole token (with 18 decimals) to subscribe
  this mechanics possible will break if token has not 18 decimals.
  probably we need to set multiplex = token decimals or we need to set 18 _decimals
  as a standard token decimals

  advertisment is selling for tokens, price is setting up by owner of Subscription
  it will give us ability to separate price for subscription and price for advertisment
  inside channel, so user can buy subscription for 0.01$ but by advertisment for 100$ for example

  NOTE also that for now it is only basic functionality for buing advertisment
  in the future I suppose we need to improve this, to give owner ability to accept OR
  reject incoming ads proposals before accepting payments
